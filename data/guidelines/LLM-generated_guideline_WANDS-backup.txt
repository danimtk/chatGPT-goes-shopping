To label products as 'Relevant' or 'Not relevant' based on the relationships between the query and the returned product, consider the following guidelines:

1. Relevance:
- A product is considered 'Relevant' if it directly matches the user's intent or closely aligns with the query's context.
- Look for products that fulfill the purpose or function described in the query.
- Consider products that have similar features, characteristics, or qualities as mentioned in the query.
- Take into account products that are commonly associated with the query's topic or category.

Examples:
- For the query 'meditation,' a relevant product could be the 'Carelton Feng Shui Zen Meditating Japanese Jizo Cat Monk on Lotus Throne Figurine' as it aligns with the concept of meditation and represents a meditating figure.
- In the query 'hardwood beds,' the 'Meryl Solid Wood Platform Bed' would be relevant as it matches the material (hardwood) and the product type (bed).

2. Not relevance:
- A product is considered 'Not relevant' if it does not fulfill the purpose or function described in the query.
- Exclude products that have no connection to the query's context, topic, or category.
- Disregard products that have different features, characteristics, or qualities than those mentioned in the query.
- Avoid products that are not commonly associated with the query's topic.

Examples:
- In the query 'nettie 5 pc bar set,' the 'Multipack 5'' Center to Center Bar Pull' would be not relevant as it is a hardware item and does not match the intended furniture or deco product.
- For the query 'kids chair,' the 'Heinz 30'' Wide Cowhide Butterfly Chair' would be not relevant as it is a chair for adults and not specifically designed for kids.

Remember, the goal is to understand the user's intent and match it with the most suitable products. Consider the context, purpose, and likely intent behind the query when deciding whether a product is 'Relevant' or 'Not relevant.'
